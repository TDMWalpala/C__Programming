(Q1)  If a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 4 get the answers for the following equations using your C programming knowledge. (Note: The answers should be in 2 decimal points.) 
                                
          a. (a+b)/(c+d)
          b. a+b/(c+d) 
          c. (a+b)/c+d 
          d. a*b/c*d 
          
   Provide your answers in the program as a comment.
          
(Q2) If a = 1, write a C program to do the following evaluations; 
         
          a. a 
          b. a++ 
          c. ++a 
          d. a— 
          e. --a 
  Explain why “a” obtains those different values and provide your answers in the program as a comment.      


(Q3) Write a C program for the following pseudo code using your logical operator knowledge and provide your answers in the program as a comment.
          
          int m = 40; 
          int n = 20;
          int o = 20;
          int p = 30;
   If the result is TRUE print 1 or FALSE print 0 
         
          I. (m>n and m !=0)
          II. (o>p or p!=20)
          III. (not (m>n and m !=0)) 
     
     
(Q4) If the following declarations and assignments are made, 
         
          I. char C = ‘B’; 
          II. int i = 3, j = 3, k = 3;
          III. double x = 0.0, y = 2.3;
   Evaluate the following expressions.
       
          a. i && j && k 
          b. x || i && j - 3 
          c. i < j && x < y 
          d. i < j || x < y 
          e. ‘A’ <= C && C <= ‘Z’
          f. C - 1 == ‘A’ || C + 1 == ‘Z’ 
   (Hint: Use printf((x,y) ? "true" : "false") format to print a boolean value) 
     
     
(Q5) Write a program that computes X^N.
        
          X^N = X * X * X * ... * X
